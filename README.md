# ML_-Models
## Overview
This repository, `ml_model`, is a comprehensive collection of various machine learning models used in different projects. It serves as a one-stop resource for anyone looking to understand the practical application of machine learning algorithms in real-world scenarios.
1. **Logistic Regression**: Used for binary classification problems such as email spam detection:
  This project is a Machine Learning model that classifies emails as either spam or ham (not spam). The model is built using Logistic Regression, a popular algorithm for binary classification problems. The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle and contains various emails.
 **Result:** The model has been trained and tested, yielding an accuracy of 94%. It demonstrates high precision and recall, particularly for classifying ham emails, where it achieved a precision of 0.88 and a recall of 1.00. For spam emails, the model achieved a precision of 1.00 and a recall of 0.91. These results indicate that the model is highly effective at correctly classifying both spam and ham emails.
